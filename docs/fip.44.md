FIP-44 proposes adding an "AuthenticateMessage" method to the Filecoin protocol, allowing arbitrary actors to verify that they have approved a piece of data. This method can be implemented by any actor, and can be called by any other actor to authenticate a piece of data. The method will be added to the built-in Account actor and modified in the Storage Market and Payment Channel actors to call this method instead of validating signatures directly. This proposal is the first step towards enabling non-account actors to function as clients for storage deals and enables future innovation that relies on the ability of non-account actors to authenticate data as approved.

Some terms related to FIP-44:

Actors: Entities in the Filecoin protocol that can be involved in computation on the blockchain.
AuthenticateMessage: A method proposed by FIP-44 that allows actors to verify the authenticity of a piece of data.
Built-in actors: Actors that are built into the Filecoin protocol, such as the Account, Storage Market, and Payment Channel actors.
Signature validation: The process of verifying the authenticity of a signature on a piece of data.

Actors: Entities in the Filecoin protocol that can be involved in computation on the Filecoin blockchain. Actors can be accounts, multisigs, or other user-defined actors.

Signature validation: The process of verifying the authenticity of a message using a digital signature. In the Filecoin protocol, only account actors can currently authenticate data using signature validation.

Authentication: The process of verifying that a message or piece of data has been approved by a particular actor. FIP-44 proposes a new method for actors to authenticate data, which will be especially useful with the introduction of the Filecoin Virtual Machine.

Built-in actors: Actors that are part of the Filecoin protocol and are included in the initial implementation. Examples include the Account actor, the Storage Market actor, and the Payment Channel actor.

AuthenticateMessageParams: The input parameters for the proposed authenticate_message method, which includes both the message and the authorization (signature) to be validated.

Dispatch model: The mechanism by which method calls are dispatched to actors in the Filecoin protocol, based on their method numbers. FIP-44 proposes a new calling convention for the authenticate_message method.
