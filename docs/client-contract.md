Client Contract idea is a contract proposal in the FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine) that allows delegating the authorization of a transaction proposal to an arbitrary FVM contract. This feature allows any Filecoin contract to act as a client of the storage market, enabling the creation of programmable storage projects and Data DAOs. The client contract consists of three conceptual building blocks: a way to add CIDs to its authorized set, an authorization policy, and a reward mechanism for storing CIDs on its wish list. Additionally, there are several variants of the client contract idea, such as data DAO implementation, perpetual storage contracts, and trusted third-party data funding.
